## Hi there 👋

I am Elena, a **Computer Engineering student** at the Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering in Skopje, currently in my final year.  
My fields of interest are **Data Science, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Embedded Systems**.  
I enjoy learning new things, experimenting with projects, and applying my academic knowledge to practical applications.

### 💻 Projects
- [**Thoracic Surgery Classification**](https://github.com/enikolovska/ThoracicSurgeryClassification) – Predicting patient mortality after thoracic surgery using machine learning models.  
- [**Spatial Interpolation**](https://github.com/enikolovska/SpatialInterpolationt) – Spatial interpolation of PM2.5 particle concentrations in the city of Oslo.  
- [**Gardenino Project**](https://github.com/enikolovska/GardeninoProject) – A mobile robotic cart equipped with sensors, designed for planting agricultural crops.  
- [**Diamond Price Prediction**](https://github.com/enikolovska/DiamondPricePrediction) – Predicting diamond prices based on their characteristics using multiple machine learning models.  
- [**Plant Diseases Project**](https://github.com/enikolovska/PlantDiseasesProject) – A deep learning model for recognizing plant diseases.  
- [**BookWormNet**](https://github.com/enikolovska/BookWormNetProject) – A personal web-based e-diary for tracking and managing books I’ve read.  
- [**CCMP Simulation**](https://github.com/enikolovska/CCMPSimulation) – Simulation of the WPA2 CCMP protocol using AES-CTR encryption and message integrity verification in Java.

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Advanced **Python** for data science  
- Machine learning techniques and model evaluation  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Arduino components and embedded systems basics
